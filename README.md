# YouTubeX
YouTube MP3 or MP4 downloader

A change in code must be necessary for proper working
  1. Change the downloadPath to the path where the downloaded video/audio should be stored.
  2. Change the path inside root.iconbitmap('D:\Code_Pythonians\PyTubeCodes\downloaderApp2\youtubeX.ico') to the path where the ico image of the app icon is downloaded.
  3. Video resolution is fixed at 720p, you can play around video = video.streams.get_by_resolution("720p") to choose your needed resolution.
